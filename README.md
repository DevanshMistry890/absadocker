# Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification üòç

## Abstract
<b>
Aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC) aims to predict sentiment polarities of
different aspects within sentences or documents. Many previous studies have been conducted
to solve this problem, but previous works fail to notice the correlation between the aspect‚Äôs sentiment
polarity and the local context. In this paper, a Local Context Focus (LCF) mechanism is proposed for
aspect-based sentiment classification based on Multi-head Self-Attention (MHSA). This mechanism is
called LCF design, and utilizes the Context features Dynamic Mask (CDM) and Context Features
Dynamic Weighted (CDW) layers to pay more attention to the local context words. Moreover,
a BERT-shared layer is adopted to LCF design to capture internal long-term dependencies of local
context and global context. Experiments are conducted on three common ABSC datasets: the
laptop and restaurant datasets of SemEval-2014 and the ACL twitter dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LCF baseline model achieves considerable performance. In addition, we
conduct ablation experiments to prove the significance and effectiveness of LCF design. Especially,
by incorporating with BERT-shared layer, the LCF-BERT model refreshes state-of-the-art performance
on all three benchmark datasets.
